Project Description
-------
This project was created to meet requirements for Project 2 in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program (June 2014).

Intended to test our ability to work in groups, this project utilizes Ruby, Rails, Javascript, JSON, & AJAX; it is comprised of four models.

This project was brainstormed, scoped and developed in one week.  If given more time, we have included a list of additional features to add to the project; we also have identified areas of code to refactor.
